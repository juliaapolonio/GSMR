Calculating allele frequencies ...
Checking allele frequencies among the GWAS summary data and the reference sample...
78 SNP(s) have large difference of allele frequency between the GWAS summary data and the reference sample. These SNPs have been saved in [MATN3_BDEP_rsID.freq.badsnps].

Forward GSMR analysis for exposure #1 and outcome #1 ...
1 index SNPs are obtained from the clumping analysis with p < 5.0e-08 and LD r2 < 0.05.
1 index SNPs are retained after HEIDI-outlier analysis.
Forward GSMR analysis for exposure #1 and outcome #1 completed.
