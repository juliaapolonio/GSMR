2424 genome-wide significant SNPs in common between the exposure(s) and the outcome(s).
Filtering out SNPs with multiple alleles or missing value ...
2424 SNPs are retained after filtering.
2418 genome-wide significant SNPs with p < 5.0e-08 are in common among the exposure(s), the outcome(s) and the LD reference sample.

Calculating allele frequencies ...
Checking allele frequencies among the GWAS summary data and the reference sample...
111 SNP(s) have large difference of allele frequency between the GWAS summary data and the reference sample. These SNPs have been saved in [CTSC_BDEP_rsID.freq.badsnps].

Forward GSMR analysis for exposure #1 and outcome #1 ...
2 index SNPs are obtained from the clumping analysis with p < 5.0e-08 and LD r2 < 0.05.
Warning: Not enough SNPs to perform the GSMR analysis. At least 1 SNPs are required.

Warning: Not enough SNP instruments to be saved in the compressed text file.
Saving the GSMR analyses results of 1 exposure(s) and 1 outcome(s) to [CTSC_BDEP_rsID.gsmr] ...
